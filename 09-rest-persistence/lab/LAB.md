## Submission Instructions
* Work in a fork of this repository
* Work in a branch on your fork
* Create a PR to your master from your working branch.
* Submit on canvas:
  * a question and observation
  * how long you spent
  * link to your pull request
  
## Configuration 
Configure the root of your repository with the necessary files and directories. Thoughfully name and organize any aditional configuration or module files. E.g.
* **README.md** - contains documentation
* **.env** - contains env variables (should be git ignored)
* **.gitignore** - contains a [robust](http://gitignore.io) `.gitignore` file 
* **.eslintrc** - contains the course linter configuratoin
* **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
* **package.json** - contains npm package config
  * create a `lint` script for running eslint (eslint **/*.js)
  * create a `test` script for running tests
  * create a `start` script for running your server
* **index.js** - the entry point for your application
* **src/** - contains your core application files and folders
* **src/app.js** - (or main.js) contains your core application bootstrap
* **src/lib/** - contains module definitions
* **\_\_test\_\_/** - contains unit tests

## Learning Objectives  
* students will learn to use promise constructs to manage asynchronous code
* students will learn to create a vanilla RESTful API with in-memory persistence
* students will learn how to save resource data to the file system for a layer of data persistence
* students will learn how to refactor commonly used coding constructs into custom helper modules

#### Feature Tasks
* continue working on your http server from the previous class
* create an HTTP server using the native NodeJS `http` module
* create an HTTP server using the native NodeJS `http` module
* create a custom parser module that:
  * uses promises to parse the JSON body of `POST` and `PUT` requests
  * uses the NodeJS `url` and `querystring` modules to parse the request url
* create a router constructor that allows you to register custom routes for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests
* create a data model constructor that creates a _simple resource_ (notes) with at least 3 properties
  * include an `id` property that is set to a unique id (**hint:** you'll need to use `node-uuid`)
  * include two additional properties of your choice (ex: name, content, etc.)
* create a data model storage interface that can store data through different storage mechanisms.
  * create storage modules for in-memory and file-system storage

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/vi/notes
* `POST` request
 * pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a **POST** request to create a new resource
* `GET` request
 * pass `?id=<uuid>` as a query string parameter to retrieve a specific resource (as JSON)
* `DELETE` request
 * pass `?id=<uuid>` in the query string to **DELETE** a specific resource
 * this should return a 204 status code with no content in the body

## Tests
* write a test to ensure that your api returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* write tests to ensure the `/api/simple-resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
 * `GET`: test 404, it should respond with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
 * `GET`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no id was provided in the request
 * `GET`: test 200, it should contain a response body for a request made with a valid id
 * `POST`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no request body was provided or the body was invalid
 * `POST`: test 200, it should respond with the body content for a post request with a valid body
